# Connected Health Cities Information Governance Materials
The establishment of appropriate Information Governance (IG) practices was identified as being critical to the aims and objectives on the Connected Health Cities (CHC) Programme.  To this end the CHC Hub implemented an IG Workstream.  The aim of the IG workstream was to deliver IG expertise to the Hub and to each of the regional CHCs; to support and work with the IG leads in each CHC; and to liaise with the IG leads within each of the host organisations to ensure that local policies and procedures were being adhered to.  The CHC appointed the Head of Information Governance, an independent IG and Privacy expert, to lead the IG workstream.
